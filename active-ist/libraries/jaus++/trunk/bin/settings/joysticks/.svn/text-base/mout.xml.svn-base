             attributes are as follows:
             
             input = user defined. For a joystick the input/axis are (X = 0,Y,Z,R,U,V,POV,POVX,POVY = 8).
             deadzone = percentage of a deadzone to use with input (e.g. joystick axis) [0,100]

             limit = [0,100] Maximum wrench effort value that can be sent.
             wrench = Wrench effort to map axis to.  Values are:
                 Propulsive Linear Effort X = 0,
