To use the program, turn on the camera, press play, and run the program:

dvgrab --frames 200 myfilm-

If you have properly configured your kernel and your ieee1394 device
drivers, you should end up with about 30 MByte of DV image data nicely
packed in a file myfilm-001.avi (digits and extension automatically
appended), which can be displayed with the Microsoft Media Player or a
similar program (remember to install the required DV codecs, software
should be included with your hardware).

Read the man page for more documentation or 'dvgrab --help'.
