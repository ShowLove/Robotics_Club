To add build support for Basler Camera's you need to 
install their SDK for your specific camera.  The main
site for Basler can be found at:

www.baslerweb.com

The specific download page used for this current build can
be found here:

http://www.baslerweb.com/MV_Customer_Service_Downloads_pylon-Linux-Text-16855.html

Download the version of the SDK for your platform and install it before
trying to build CvCapture, otherwise support will not be added.  You will
know if the library was successfully found when running CMake on CvCapture
because a message will be output indicating that Basler support is 
being enabled.
