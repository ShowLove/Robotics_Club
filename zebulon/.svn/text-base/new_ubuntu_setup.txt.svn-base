THIS IS OLD AND NEEDS TO BE RAVAMPED, BE WARNED!!

NEW UBUNTU INSTALL PROCEDURES

1)  Install all the third party libraries and applications, including the repository
    sudo apt-get install ssh subversion build-essential esvn libwxgtk2.8-dev libgtk2.0-dev libwxgtk2.8-dbg libdv4-dev libavc1394-dev libiec61883-dev libcv-dev libdc1394-22-dev libxtst-dev libhighgui-dev libv4l-dev libboost-all-dev libqt4-dev cmake qtcreator liburg0-dev libsdl1.2-dev

2)  Download Active-ist
    svn co https://active-ist.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/active-ist active-ist

3)  Download Zebulon
    svn co https://zebulon.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/zebulon/v4/software software/zebulon/v4/software

4)  To setup QT Creator, refer to the file "setup_qtcreator.txt" in this folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6)  In Codelite - Open jaus++ 2.0, then build workspace for both release and debug(it will compile tinyxml, cxutils, jaus)
    And will install them to /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include (if it complains about mingw32-make.exe and doesn't compile, this is a codelite settings 	bug, go to Settings->Build Settings->Build Systems and change Build tool to just make instead of mingw32-make.exe)

7)  Then you can open up any project (like Underwater or Compass)
    And they will build and install in /usr/local

8)  Add paths to your ld.so.conf so the executables no all of the library paths
    Edit: /etc/ld.so.conf (you will need to be root or sudo)
    
    sudo gedit /etc/ld.so.conf
    Add these lines:
    /usr/local/lib/active
    /usr/local/lib/zebulon
    
    Also run after editing:
    sudo ldconfig

9) Support for OpenSceneGraph
   Download the source from: http://www.openscenegraph.org/projects/osg/wiki/Downloads
   Install the dependencies for building library: sudo apt-get build-dep openscenegraph
   Unzip the source download for OSG, and go into the folder from a command line.
   Type: ./configure
         make
         sudo make install

   All should go well, if not refer to OSG website.  You may also need to add /usr/local/lib to your 
   ld.so.conf (see step 8).

   If you have the error "./configure permission denied" then run sudo chmod -R 777 <folder_name> where
   folder name is the name of the OpenSceneGraph folder.

10) Extra setup for Robot platform and sensors

Set up to not rescan harddrive ever
sudo tune2fs -c -1 /dev/sda1

To prevent grub from halting on improper boot:
edit /etc/grub.d/00_header
and remove the line:   set recordfail=1

To fix the firewire issue to not use sudo:
edit /lib/udev/rules.d/50-udev-default.rules
and change the lines:
# FireWire (deprecated dv1394 and video1394 drivers)
KERNEL=="dv1394-[0-9]*",        NAME="dv1394/%n", GROUP="video"
KERNEL=="video1394-[0-9]*",     NAME="video1394/%n", GROUP="video"
to
KERNEL=="raw1394", NAME="%k", GROUP="video"
KERNEL=="dv1394*",        NAME="dv1394/%n", GROUP="video"
KERNEL=="video1394*",     NAME="video1394/%n", GROUP="video"

And add your user to the video group
sudo adduser boatname video

11) For FireWire cameras, install utilities for dc1394 bus reset
sudo apt-get install libdc1394-utils
sudo dc1394_reset_bus

12) Local checkout (for at competition)
    svn co svn+ssh://developer@192.168.0.18/home/developer/svnroot/active-ist active-ist
    svn co svn+ssh://developer@192.168.0.18/home/developer/svnroot/zebulon zebulon

13) To solve the problem of having to run in sudo for the laser to work (usually only occurs in 12.04+), add yourself to the tty and dialout groups:
sudo adduser developer tty
sudo adduser developer dialout

14) To force comp to shutdown on power press with out waiting, edit:
sudo gedit /etc/acpi/powerbtn.sh
and add the line:
/sbin/shutdown -h now "Power button pressed"
to the top under the first comments.
