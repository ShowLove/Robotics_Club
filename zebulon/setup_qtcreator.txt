1. download latest version from qt.nokia.com/downloads
IDE is available without SDK, download is smaller.  Or sudo apt-get install qtcreator. this will be an older version.

2. chmod 775 nameofqtcreatorbinary file to make it executable, then run it ./nameofqtcreatorbinary and follow on screen directions.

3. Once installed, to make it executable from any directory:
   sudo ln -s /home/user/qtcreatorinstallfolder/bin/nameofqtcreatorbinary /usr/local/bin/nameofqtcreatorbinary

4. Open an existing project by navigating to your source/build/cmake directory and opening CMakeLists.txt.
5. Follow on screen directions and run cmake.  This will create the project in qtcreator. 

To Enable Debugging (this needs to be repeated for every project you load):
1. Click the projects tab to the left, in build settings, click the "add" dropdown and clone selected. Enter debug as the name.
2. Under build steps, click the "add clone of build step" drop down, "select Custom Process Step"
3. Enable step. Command: "cmake". Command arguments: "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .".
4. Move step up to the top, above the make command.
5. You may need to restart qtcreator to get debugging to work correctly.

Enable release mode:
1. Follow the same directions for setting up debugging, but make a release build step.
2. In step 3. change "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ." to "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ."

If your program requires ANY console input, it may not work correctly, follow these steps to enable(needs to be repeated for every binary that requres console input):
1. Click projects tab on the left, and to go "run settings".
2. Add a new run configuration for the binary you wish to debug.
3. Set executable name, for instance "baseline_d".
4. Set absolute path to working directory.
5. Select run in terminal.
6. Make sure this configuration is set in the project selector in the bottom left corner of qtcreator.

if you get an error mentioning "ptrace" when trying to debug, follow these directions:
0. You may have to set the terminal to xterm by going to tools>options>Environment>General and set Terminal:[] to "xterm-e"
1. sudo gedit /etc/sysctl.d/10-ptrace.conf 
2. set: kernel.yama.ptrace_scope = 0
3. close gedit, and run this command in terminal: echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope
